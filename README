DESCRIPTION:
This is my version of the trivia game. I took a different approach to coding this up to previous projects. Instead of starting
with the look (background, font color/style etc.) I started instead with the overall content and getting the timer working first. I then began 
working around the timer. I haven't tried it this way before, but just wanted to see if it would help. 

CHALLENGES:
Everything. I struggled everywhere and for the most part, not uselessly. The timer is buggy, it needs a fix, can't figure it out. 

FUTURE:
 The timer was a particular challenge to get working and I didn't get it working perfectly, will need to redress this. Also really need to style this.
 I freeze up on this portion often.
